    Welcome to my second project assigned by The Odin Project. The goal of this project is to replicate a webpage using only a provided image. This webpage will be customized so I can obtain a further grasp on the HTML and CSS features I have learned.

    I've finished the HTML and CSS for this project! I had a lot of fun learning to style things, even if it was frustrating at times. Writing the HTML was easy, but implementing CSS was trickier. It's not as easy for me to do CSS, not yet at least! I definitely need to practice styling and using flexbox a lot more, but I am happy with my work and excited to do more. I definitely feel like my skills have improved.
